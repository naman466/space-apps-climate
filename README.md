# Legacy of Earth: The Anderson Climate Chronicles

## Overview
**"Legacy of Earth: The Anderson Climate Chronicles"** is a narrative project that follows the fictional Anderson family over several generations, exploring the environmental and societal impacts of climate change. The project blends storytelling with real-world climate data, aiming to raise awareness and foster understanding of the long-term effects of global warming on future generations. By weaving personal experiences with factual information, this project seeks to create an emotional connection to the reality of climate change.

## Key Themes
- **Climate Change & Data-Driven Storytelling:** Combines storytelling with real data from sources like the US GHG Center to visualize the unfolding consequences of environmental degradation.
- **Intergenerational Impact:** Follows multiple generations of the Anderson family, showing how decisions made today affect tomorrow.
- **Environmental Education:** Provides an accessible and engaging way for people to learn about the science behind climate change and its impacts on society.
- **Global Perspective:** While the Anderson family is central, the project looks at the global consequences of climate change.

## Storyline
1. **Present Day (First Generation):** The Andersons experience the early, recognizable signs of climate change.
2. **Next Decade (Second Generation):** Society grapples with heightened resource scarcity and increased environmental activism.
3. **Future Generations:** A world reshaped by technology, geopolitical tensions, and migration, as climate change reaches its critical point.

## Features
- **Real-World Climate Data Integration:** Powered by datasets from the US GHG Center, NASA GISS, the World Resources Institute, and the Global Carbon Project, grounding the story in real science.
- **Interactive Storytelling (Future Expansion):** Options to explore the story via web experiences or VR for deeper immersion.
- **Educational & Awareness Tool:** Designed to educate and inspire action towards sustainability.

## Goals
- **Raise Awareness:** Use the power of storytelling to bring attention to climate change.
- **Foster Global Responsibility:** Encourage action by illustrating the personal and global effects of our environmental footprint.
- **Support Data Literacy:** Teach about climate science through a narrative, helping readers engage with real-world data.
